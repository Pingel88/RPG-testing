## Technologies Used
* _html, css, javascript_
* _ESLint, Jest, and npm_
* _webpack, webpack-cli, Babel_
* _VS Code, Chrome DevTools_

## Description
* a role playing game (RPG)
* tracks player and enemy stats (egs. health, accuracy, name, etc.)
* there may also be other factors that influence enemy encounters:
> armor
> weaponry
* there is no user interface built for this one yet

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Specs

**Player class**
* choose player type at start
* player instantiates with full health
* player starts at level 0
* experience starts at 0, too
* enemies, and all other characters, are instances of Player
* battle enemies make choices automatically. Also have stats/weapons.

**Event class**
* initial events allow player to:
> select player type
> select starting weapon
> select an event
* later events are presented as four options, one or two of which are chosen at random from an array of all possible events (all non-battle?)
> 1. Spend money at the tavern to regain health, salves for wounds
> 2. Go the forest to chop wood, build strength, or discover item
> 3. Pick a fight
> 4. Other wildcard events (egs. work for someone to earn money and food, choose to go after bounties, apprentice with a blacksmith...)
* perhaps a ratio is set such that a battle has to come up by every fourth turn?
* battle _possibilities:_
1. get defeated
2. win

**Item class**
* armor
* weapon
* Weapon does damage range, stats could modify range
* money?
* food?
* magic seeing stones so you can start your own religion

**Health**
* Strength could do more damage with a weapon
* Vitality could mean more health

for example, a crappy sword could do 1-10 damage, having a strength of 5 could add 5 to the damage roll or add 5 to the lower number of the range like 6-10

Armor could modify the damage received by a percentage
